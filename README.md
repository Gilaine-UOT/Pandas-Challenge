# Pandas-Challenge
Create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data

##  Observable trends based on the data.

First Trend is related to the spending ranges per student. The school that received <$585 per student performed better in comparison with spending ranges between $645 and $680 per student. Example, the overall Passing in percent for spending range <$585 per student was 90.4% while the spending between $645-680 was 53.5%.

Second trend is related to the School Type, the Charter performance of Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math and reading, also the % overall passing were better that District.
